Task 0:

What is the greeting string issued by the server to the client upon first connecting?

 - "ECE Senior Capstone IoT simulator""

Task 2:

What are the median and variance observed from the temperature data? 
 - Median: 22.976429549397288
 - Variance: 1019642.1939205542

What are the median and variance observed from the occupancy data?
 - Median: 5.0
 - Variance: 64.87875984503773

Plot the probability distribution function for each sensor type.
NEED TO ADD (images are in images folder) Note: temperature has one called tempNoOutlier.png because it has an extreme outlier (38870.0176590916) that made the graph irrelevant. So the no outlier graph cuts off values at 100. I believe this cuts off that extreme outlier and one that is around 136(?).


What is the mean and variance of the time interval of the sensor readings?
 - Mean: 0.9693993684922244
 - Variance: 0.86833733304211
 
Plot the probability distribution function for the time intervals.

Does it mimic a well-known distribution for connection intervals in large systems?
